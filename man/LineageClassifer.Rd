\title{Classifies cells into lineages based on their fate probabilities using a clustering approach.}
\usage{
LineageClassifer(
  fate_prob,
  cut_off = 2,
  maxState = 5,
  diffvar = TRUE,
  unique_assign = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fate_prob}{A matrix where rows are cells, columns are cell fates, and values are the probabilities of each cell being assigned to each fate.}

\item{cut_off}{Minimum threshold required for a cell to be assigned to a lineage. Default is 2.}

\item{maxState}{Maximum number of clusters to consider. Default is 5.}

\item{diffvar}{If TRUE, allows clusters to have different variances. Default is TRUE.}

\item{unique_assign}{If TRUE, assigns each cell to one specific lineage. If FALSE, allows overlap between lineages. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list where each element contains the cell IDs assigned to a specific lineage. Lineages with no cells are excluded.
}
\description{
Classifies cells into lineages based on their fate probabilities using a clustering approach.
}
\details{
The function uses a Gaussian mixture model (via the `mclust` package) to group cells into clusters based on cell fate probabilities. 
It assigns cells to lineages based on the specified `cut_off` threshold and whether unique or shared assignments are allowed.

\examples{
# Example usage
fate_prob <- matrix(runif(100, 0.1, 0.9), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)
rownames(fate_prob) <- paste0("Cell", 1:10)
colnames(fate_prob) <- paste0("Fate", 1:10)

result <- LineageClassifier(fate_prob, cut_off = 2, maxState = 5, diffvar = TRUE, unique_assign = FALSE)
